## About this Page

I found myself always looking for kinds of libraries either for my research or self-entertainment.
C++ under Linux and Objective-C under Mac OS or iOS are my favorite languages and I am doing cutting-edge (bragging) research in Computer Vision.  
More links will be added here. Hope these help.

## For Researchers


### Computer Vision Libraries in C++
[VXL (the Vision-something-Libraries)](http://vxl.sourceforge.net/)

> "VXL (the Vision-something-Libraries) is a collection of C++ libraries designed for computer vision research and implementation. It was created from TargetJr and the IUE with the aim of making a light, fast and consistent system. VXL is written in ANSI/ISO C++ and is designed to be portable over many platforms."

## For Developers

### GUI Libraries in C++
[Crazy Eddie's GUI System](http://www.cegui.org.uk/)

> "Crazy Eddie's GUI System is a free library providing windowing and widgets for graphics APIs / engines where such functionality is not natively available, or severely lacking. The library is object orientated, written in C++, and targeted at games developers who should be spending their time creating great games, not building GUI sub-systems!"
