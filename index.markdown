## About this Page

I found myself always looking for kinds of libraries either for my research or self-entertainment.
C++ under Linux and Objective-C under Mac OS or iOS are my favorite languages and I am doing cutting-edge (bragging) research in Computer Vision.  
More links will be added here. Hope these help.

<!--## For Researchers-->

### Computer Vision Libraries in C++
[VXL (the Vision-something-Libraries)](http://vxl.sourceforge.net/)

> "VXL (the Vision-something-Libraries) is a collection of C++ libraries designed for computer vision research and implementation. It was created from TargetJr and the IUE with the aim of making a light, fast and consistent system. VXL is written in ANSI/ISO C++ and is designed to be portable over many platforms."

[VLFeat](http://www.vlfeat.org/)

> "The VLFeat open source library implements popular computer vision algorithms including HOG, SIFT, MSER, k-means, hierarchical k-means, agglomerative information bottleneck, SLIC superpixels, and quick shift. It is written in C for efficiency and compatibility, with interfaces in MATLAB for ease of use, and detailed documentation throughout. It supports Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux."

I am using vlfeat in my own projects. You can find functions utilizing SSE instructions, which are really helpful for speeding up.

### Computation Libraries in C++
[Intel® Math Kernel Library](http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl)

> "Intel® Math Kernel Library (Intel® MKL) 11.0 includes a wealth of routines to accelerate application performance and reduce development time."

This one gives your amazing acceleration over your Intel processors. I hope you are working under Linux because Intel provides non-commercial licenses for MKL Linux.

<!--## For Developers-->

### GUI Libraries in C++
[Crazy Eddie's GUI System](http://www.cegui.org.uk/)

> "Crazy Eddie's GUI System is a free library providing windowing and widgets for graphics APIs / engines where such functionality is not natively available, or severely lacking. The library is object orientated, written in C++, and targeted at games developers who should be spending their time creating great games, not building GUI sub-systems!"
